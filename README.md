<h2>Goal</h2>
<p>I've started this project just to understand how CSS Grid works and how to create something Responsive, but ended up creating this whole page.</p>
<p>As far as I have tested it - it's a fully responsive design that works and looks okay(ish) on every single device in my house.</p>

<h2>Responsive Design</h2>

The main goal here was to use Grid Layout EVERYWHERE and teach myself some basic JS in the way.
